# Web Development Prompt: Iron Man vs. Captain America (Civil War) Fight Scene

**Objective:**
Create a visually stunning, frontend-only webpage that recreates the emotional and intense final fight scene between Iron Man (Tony Stark) and Captain America (Steve Rogers) from *Captain America: Civil War*. The page should be purely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no backend dependencies.

**Theme:**
- **Dark Mode**: The overall aesthetic must be dark, gritty, and cinematic. Use deep grays, blacks, and muted blues to represent the Siberian Hydra bunker.
- **Atmosphere**: Emotional, intense, and dramatic.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Layout & Setting:**
    -   A full-screen interactive canvas or container.
    -   Background: A dark, metallic, industrial setting (the silo/bunker) with falling snow or sparks for effect.

2.  **Characters & Visuals:**
    -   Use high-quality CSS art, SVG shapes, or carefully placed transparent images/sprites to represent Iron Man and Captain America.
    -   **Iron Man**: Show his suit damage, glowing Arc Reactor, and repulsor beams.
    -   **Captain America**: Show his shield, combat stance, and gritty determination.

3.  **Animations (The Fight Sequence):**
    -   Implement a scripted animation sequence using CSS Keyframes or JavaScript (GSAP preferred if external libraries are allowed, otherwise vanilla JS).
    -   **Action 1: The Clash**: Cap charging with his shield vs. Iron Man flying in with repulsors.
    -   **Action 2: Repulsor Blasts**: Glowing beams of light firing from Iron Man, creating lighting effects on the dark background.
    -   **Action 3: Shield Deflection**: Cap using his shield to deflect beams, causing sparks to fly.
    -   **Action 4: The Final slow-mo**: A dramatic slow-motion moment where punches are exchanged or the shield clashes with the armor.

4.  **Audio & Effects (Optional but recommended):**
    -   Visual sound effects (screen shake on impact).
    -   Particle effects for sparks and debris.

5.  **Tech Stack:**
    -   **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
    -   **CSS3**: Flexbox/Grid for layout, extensive use of `box-shadow` for glowing effects, and `@keyframes` for movement.
    -   **JavaScript**: To control the fight sequence logic and handle any user interactions (e.g., "Start Fight" button).

**Constraints:**
-   Single HTML file (or separate CSS/JS files if organized in a folder).
-   Responsive design (should look good on desktop).
-   No database or server-side code.

**Deliverable:**
A complete code snippet or folder structure containing `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` that renders this animated fight scene immediately upon opening in a browser.
